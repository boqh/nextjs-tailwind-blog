## Hello World!

You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.
                                                                    *-- Zig Ziglar*



If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.
                                                                    *-- Napoleon Hill*



Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.
                                                                    *-- Vincent Van Gogh*



Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
                                                                    *-- Albert Einstein*



Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.
                                                                    *-- Albert Einstein*
